# Wordament
This is my version of a Microsoft Word Game that I used to love playing in high school, called Wordament. The objective is to swipe using the mouse
across a board of different augo-generated letters and try to make words. Correct words will add to your score, and you have to be quick, since there is a two minute time limit!.
